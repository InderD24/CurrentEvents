# CurrentEvents

This repository contains a playful webpage that mixes "current events" with literal currents. An ocean-wave animation rolls across the screen while a news livestream plays in the center. The project is a lighthearted demonstration of HTML and CSS animations.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to view the page. The stylesheet `style.css` contains the animations used for the waves.


## Features
- Animated waves using CSS keyframes
- Embedded YouTube video set to autoplay
- Simple page layout centered using flexbox
- Playful twist on "current events" with ocean currents in the background

## Customization
You can replace the YouTube video URL in `index.html` with your own link. The wave animations and colors are defined in `style.css`, so feel free to tweak them for different moods.
